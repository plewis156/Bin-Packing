Compiling the program:

A makefile for the program has been provided. Simply type "make" when in the directory.

Alternatively, the program can be compiled using the command:
gcc -Wall binPacking.c bin.c -o binPacking

Running the program:

Simply type the following command after compiling to run the program:
./binPacking

The program requires a file "items.txt" in order to run.
This file must contain the number of runs, the size of each run, and the items used in each run.
The items.txt used to test the program has been provided in the Documents folder of the program.
This file must be moved to the main directory of the program in order to use it.
(This is because the grader will probably use their own items.txt which will overwrite it.)

The user may use the following command to send the output to a file for ease of viewing:
./binPacking >output.txt

An empty text file named "output.txt" has been provided for this purpose.
