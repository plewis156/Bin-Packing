# Bin-Packing

A program to test the bin packing problem. Tests both online (i.e., once the algorithm gets an item, it places it in a bin immediately) and offline (i.e., the algorithm receives all items and then decides what to do with them before placing bins) approaches to the problem.

The program uses three heuristic approximation algorithms (Next Fit, First Fit, and Best Fit) to attempt to solve a problem which is NP-complete.
